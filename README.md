# Lab 2: Student Performance Prediction

In this lab, I selected the "Student Performance" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Problem Statement:**
This is a Regression problem. The goal is to predict the final student grade (column `G3`) based on other information in the dataset like study time, failures, and absences.
